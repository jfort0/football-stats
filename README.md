# football-stats

A shot at football statistics.

Few projects in here:

- team stats for all leagues, guided by Sergi's blog (https://www.sergilehkyi.com/2019/06/web-scraping-advanced-football-statistics/)
- player statistics
- heat maps for passes and dribbles, guided by McKay Johns' videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx0F1QjOq5A)
